# Perfect Season: product spec (v0.1)

A multi-sport "spin a random team and decade, draft legends, chase a perfect season" game. NBA first.
This spec records every decision made so far, with starting numbers for the systems. Every number is a **starting value**, tunable from the admin config (§13).
Research on the game we're learning from is in the 82-0 teardown, [`research/82-0/README.md` in random-stuff-](https://github.com/qemmhd/random-stuff-/blob/perfect-season-app/research/82-0/README.md).

> **The name's built-in goal:** a perfect NBA season here is **82-0 in the regular season plus 16-0 in the playoffs**: 98 straight wins.

## 2. Core loop (NBA)

1. **Home**: big PLAY button, a mode picker (Classic / Blind / Daily / 1v1), and a sport carousel (NBA live, others "coming soon").
2. **Draft (5 rounds):**
   - SPIN rolls a TEAM reel and an ERA reel (the era reel lands about 250 ms after the team reel).
   - The drawer slides up with the full roster for that team-decade, showing games and seasons played. It can be sorted by stat.
   - Tap a player; their eligible open slots glow; tap a slot to place them. Placed jerseys take the team colors and the player's initials.
   - Live category bars (Scoring / Rebounding / Playmaking / Defense) update after each pick.
   - Under the reels: **free Team respin ×1** and **free Era respin ×1**; after that, respins cost coins.
   - Booster tray at the bottom (Prime / Trade / Double Pick).
3. **Season reveal**: a scoreboard counts up wins and losses to the final record in about 3 seconds, flashing highlights such as "Won 23 straight" or "Swept the Finals favorite."
4. **Playoffs**: 4 best-of-7 series against all-time great teams. Each series result animates (games tick 4-2, etc.). You can lose.
5. **Results**: record, playoff outcome, grade and tier, category breakdown, the five players, coins and XP earned, then **Share**, **Draft again**, and **Leaderboard**.

---

## 3. Rating model

**Inputs:** for each of the five players, per-game PTS, REB, AST, STL, BLK averaged over their games for that team in that decade. The list shows these real numbers. The score uses a **rated** version of the same line:

- **Era:** each season's stats are divided by that season's league average per team-game and put on the 1960–2026 average scale.
  - Early-1960s teams saw about 1.7× the rebounds of any team since the mid-1970s. Raw stats made 1960s spins a jackpot and gave Wilt a value 50% above any modern star.
  - Tested on every real team-season since 1960, rating each team's top 5 by minutes: rated stats predict the actual win% with r = 0.48, against 0.39 for raw stats. Every decade's best players now score within 8% of each other.
- **Small samples:** a stint is blended with the player's career rate as if he had played 10 more games at it. A one-game cameo (Edy Tavares, 6 blocks in his only Cavs game) no longer rates like a full season; a 300-game stint moves by about 3%.
- Missing pre-1973-74 STL/BLK are **estimated** from the player's rated points, rebounds, assists and position, and flagged "est.".

The stat weights stay as measured from 82-0. A least-squares fit on real teams improves the correlation only from 0.48 to 0.50, so they are kept for familiarity.

**Step 1. Base strength:** a weighted team total. We start from 82-0's measured weights, which give rebounds and defense their real value:

```
base = 0.33·PTS + 0.67·REB + 0.64·AST + 1.20·STL + 1.13·BLK      (team totals)
```

**Step 2. Balance against a benchmark ("near-perfect team").** Each category is scored against a benchmark total: PTS 125, REB 51, AST 31, and defense (1.2·STL + 1.13·BLK) 16. That is about the 97th percentile of skilled drafts in each category:

```
ratio_k   = team_total_k / benchmark_k            (one per category)
balance   = min(ratio) / mean(ratio)              (1.0 = perfectly balanced)
rating    = base × (0.85 + 0.15 × balance)
```

A lopsided team (huge scoring, no rim protection) loses up to 15%. This is the "a deficiency in one category can cost you" rule, made visible in the breakdown.

**Step 3. Regular-season wins:** a power curve that flattens near the top:

> **Tuned in the build** (`src/engine/rating.ts`, `sim.test.ts`): a piecewise-linear curve replaced the formula below. Its anchors are quantiles of simulated drafts:
> - Random picks: 18 / 30 / 36 wins at the 10th / 50th / 90th percentile.
> - Best available: 52 / 57 / 64.
> - The top 1% of skilled drafts: 75+. The top ~0.15%: 82-0.
>
> **Playoffs:**
> - A team needs **50 wins** (the C · Playoff Team grade) to get in. Below that it is in the lottery.
> - Opponent pools are 50–55 / 55–59 / 59–63 / 64+ wins, and each game is a logistic on the rating gap with `SERIES_K = 12`, plus 4% for the home team.
> - Title odds are about 12% at 62 wins, 45% at 70 and 88% at 82-0. An 82-0 team sweeps all four rounds about 4% of the time.
> - These match a back-of-envelope check on series odds against those opponents.

```
wins = clamp(round(0.332 × rating^1.15), 0, 82)        (82-0's measured curve; used in the mockup)
```

82-0 needs a rating of about 120. Once the data pipeline exists we'll tune the exponent and the benchmark, and optionally flatten the top above about 70 wins, so that:
- a random team lands at about 38–45 wins;
- the best pick every round with no boosters lands at about 58–66;
- 70+ needs good luck plus smart respins;
- **82-0 is about 0.5% of drafts.**

**Grades (by regular-season wins):**

| Grade | Wins | Tier name (ours) | Color |
|---|---|---|---|
| F | 0–37 | Rebuilding | red |
| D | 38–49 | Lottery Bound | slate |
| C | 50–56 | Playoff Team | amber |
| B | 57–62 | Contender | blue |
| A | 63–68 | Juggernaut | teal |
| A+ | 69–74 | Dynasty | bright teal |
| S | 75–81 | Legendary | gold |
| S+ | 82-0 | **Perfect** | animated gold |

On top of the grade there's a **Champion** badge if you win the title, and **PERFECT SEASON** if you go 82-0 and then 16-0.

(Reference: 82-0's observed bands are F ≤36, D 41–42, C 51–56, B 57–61, A 62–64; above that wasn't observed.)

---

## 4. Playoffs

- **Bracket:** 4 rounds, best-of-7. Opponents are **real historical teams**, drawn from a pool by round:
  - Round 1: about 55–60-win teams;
  - Round 2: about 60–64;
  - Conference finals: about 64–67;
  - **Finals boss**: a top-10 all-time team (e.g. '96 Bulls, '17 Warriors, '86 Celtics, '72 Lakers, '67 76ers, '71 Bucks).
- **Opponent rating:** the team's real record mapped back through the same curve.
- **Per-game win chance:** `p = 1 / (1 + e^(−(our_rating − opp_rating)/k))`, with a home-court edge of about +3% for the better seed. Each game is simulated with luck, so a 70-win team can lose a Finals.
- **Rewards:** coins for each series won, plus a title bonus.

## 5. Modes

| Mode | Rules |
|---|---|
| **Classic** | Stats visible. Counts toward the Classic board. |
| **Blind** | Stats hidden; the server sends **no stats**, so it can't be cheated. Alphabetical list with the sort control disabled. **+50% coins and XP.** Its own board. |
| **Daily** | Seeded by date: everyone gets the same 5 spins in the same order (respins also seeded). The first attempt is ranked and shareable ("Perfect Season #142: 71-11, lost in the Finals 3-4"). Replays are practice and unranked. Daily board, with a streak counter. |
| **1v1 vs bot** | One shared spin per round; snake order (A-B, B-A, …), with a coin flip for first pick. Both pick from the same team-decade, so you can take the player the bot wants. 20-second turn timer with auto-pick. Bot levels:
  - **Rookie:** one of the three best on paper. You always pick first.
  - **Pro:** the best fit for its team, balance included, now and then the next best. A coin flip decides who starts.
  - **Legend:** the best fit; when it picks first it also takes away the player who would help you most. It always starts.
  - Against a player who simply takes the best available, you win about 94% / 68% / 39%.
  - Like you, the bot only places players at positions they played. When nobody in the round's team fits, it gets a free redraw of its own. Higher levels pay more. Later: "challenge a friend" async links. **Bots are always labelled as bots**; 82-0 got complaints for passing bots off as people. |

## 6. Boosters and respins

| Item | Effect | Unlock | Price (coins) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Team respin | Re-roll the team reel | Lv1 (1 free per draft) | 25 per extra |
| Era respin | Re-roll the era reel | Lv1 (1 free per draft) | 25 per extra |
| Double Pick | Take two players from this team-decade this round | Lv2 (+1 free on unlock) | 60 |
| Trade | Swap the new pick with a player already on your team | Lv3 (+1 free on unlock) | 70 |
| Prime | Upgrade a pick to that player's best team-decade stat line (any team) | Lv4 (+1 free on unlock) | 100 |

- Limit: one booster of each kind per draft. **No boosters in Daily or 1v1**, to keep those fair (free respins still apply).
- **Booster hints:** a "Good moment for a PRIME!" nudge when a booster would add at least 5 rating points. It can be turned off in settings.

---

## 7. Economy (earned only)

| Source | Coins | XP |
|---|---|---|
| Finish a draft, by grade | F 20 · D 25 · C 30 · B 40 · A 50 · A+ 55 · S 60 · S+ 100 | 40 |
| Each playoff series won | +10 | +10 |
| Championship | +25 | +20 |
| Blind mode | ×1.5 on all of the above | ×1.5 |
| 1v1 win | Rookie +15 · Pro +30 · Legend +50 | +20 |
| Daily: first completion | +25 | +20 |
| Level up | +50 and the level's booster | |

**Levels:** XP needed per level is 70, 110, 140, 170, then +30 each (82-0's curve). A typical game gives 40–90 XP, so level 4 comes after about 6 games.

A typical C–B game with one series win earns about 40–50 coins. That's an extra respin almost every game and a Prime every 2–3 games, which matches "generous".

---

## 8. Leaderboards

- Boards: **Classic**, **Blind**, **Daily (today)**; windows: All-time / Weekly / Today.
- Ranking: **best single result** (regular-season wins, then playoff result, then rating as tie-breaks).
- Only **ranked runs** count. Ranked runs are **server-authoritative**: spins are rolled in a Supabase edge function, picks are validated, and the score is computed on the server. Practice runs can be fully client-side.
- Guests can see boards; signing in puts them on the board.
- **Built so far (no accounts, no server):** a player picks a name on first launch, and a key kept on the phone stands in for an account. Entries go to five public Nostr relays as signed, replaceable app-data events (one per player per board), and every phone checks each entry against the player data before ranking it. Head to Head runs over the same relays. Moving ranked runs to a server, as above, is the step that would make the boards fully cheat-proof.

---

## 9. Sharing

- A generated **image card** (record, grade, playoff result, the 5 players with team colors and decades, and "Can you go perfect?"), plus text and a link that opens the same lineup.
- Daily share text: `Perfect Season #142 🏀 71-11 · A+ Dynasty · Lost Finals 3-4 to '96 Bulls → perfectseason.gg/d/142`

---

## 10. Look and feel (to be validated in the mockup)

- **Palette:** background `#04121A`, card `#0A1F2A`, line `#16323F`, **primary teal `#19E3C9`** (actions, active tab, eligible slots), **gold `#F5B83D`** (wins, champion, S grades), text `#F2F6F7` / `#8FA6B2`. TEAM reel in teal, ERA reel in gold.
- **Type:** a heavy condensed italic display face for PLAY / SPIN / records, and a clean sans for UI. Avoid 82-0's exact fonts; candidates are Oswald or Anton for display and Inter for UI.
- **Layout:** a 390px-wide design frame scaled to the phone's width (×1.10 on a 430px iPhone 15 Pro Max). Height is flexible, with four spacing classes from compact (iPhone SE in Safari) to roomy.
  - Backgrounds run under the Dynamic Island and home indicator; content and controls stay inside the safe area.
  - Portrait only, like a native app. iOS can't lock a website's rotation, so on a sideways phone the frame turns itself back to stay upright relative to the phone, with the island still at its top. Tablets and desktops get a phone-shaped frame.
- **Motion:** reel wind-up → blur → ease-out → 6 px bounce; jersey drop and glint on placement; ticker and confetti on results, with confetti density by grade.
- **Sounds:** spin start, reel tick, reel stop, pick, place, draft complete, ticker, playoff win and loss stings, title fanfare, coin, level up, button.
- **Hero art:** **stylized poster/comic illustration** of generic athletes in teal and gold (not photoreal like 82-0). The same style works for every sport.
- **On-court players:** **mini player cards** in team colors (initials, decade, rating number) rather than jerseys.
- **No NBA or team logos**: teams appear as abbreviation plus colors only.

## 11. Data pipeline (NBA)

1. **Sources:** per-season, per-team player totals for 1960-61 → today: games, minutes, PTS, REB, AST, STL, BLK, and listed position. Candidates are public historical NBA datasets (e.g. Kaggle databases built from stats.nba.com) and `nba_api` for modern seasons; check reference sites' terms before scraping. **ABA excluded.**
2. **Decades:** a season belongs to the decade it **ends** in (1989-90 counts as the 1990s). This is 82-0's rule, verified: Ewing's NYK 1990s line of 24.08 ppg / 11.02 rpg is exactly the games-weighted average of his 1989-90 → 1998-99 seasons.
3. **Aggregate** per (player, franchise identity, decade): games-weighted per-game averages over **all** of that player's seasons with that team in that decade (not a best-N stretch), plus games and seasons played.
4. **Estimate STL/BLK before 1973-74** (regression; flagged in the data and the UI).
5. **Positions:** career positions weighted by games: every listed position with at least 12% of the player's games, up to three (LeBron SF/PF, Magic PG/SG, Jordan SG/SF, Ewing C). Players with no listed position get the nearest one by stat profile. Checked by hand for the stars.
6. **Franchise identities:** about 45 historical names with decade ranges and colors (St. Louis Hawks 1960s → Atlanta, Buffalo Braves → Clippers, Vancouver → Memphis, Seattle SuperSonics, New Jersey Nets, Charlotte Bobcats…).
7. **Prime line:** each player's best team-decade line by base value.
8. **Output:** a versioned JSON or DB seed, with spot-check reports (top 10 per team-decade).
9. **Playoff opponents:** a curated list of about 60 historical great teams with their records and core players.

---

## 12. Tech architecture

- **Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind** on Vercel. Sound with Howler or the Web Audio API; haptics with `navigator.vibrate` where it's supported.
- **Supabase:** anonymous guest auth that upgrades to Google or email (magic link); Postgres tables for `profiles`, `wallets`, `runs`, `daily_seeds`, `leaderboard` views, and `config`; **edge functions** `start_run`, `spin`, `pick`, `finish_run` for ranked play.
- **Scoring engine:** one pure TypeScript package shared by the client (practice and live bars) and the edge functions (ranked).
- **Sport plugins:** `{ slots, eras, franchises, stats, weights, benchmark, seasonLength, playoffFormat }`, so NFL or soccer can be added without touching the core.
- **Config:** a `config` table, edited in an admin page, cached on the client.

---

## 13. Admin config (tunable without redeploy)

Rating weights, benchmark, curve constants, grade cut-offs, coin and XP tables, level curve, booster prices and unlock levels, respin counts, bot difficulty parameters, playoff opponent pool and k-factor, slot-machine animation timings, feature flags (modes on/off), and the daily seed salt.

---

## 14. Lessons from 82-0 to keep or avoid

- **Keep:** a 60-second loop; screenshot-able results; team colors on jerseys; slot-machine feel; Blind mode; server-side scoring for ranked play.
- **Avoid:**
  - removing the free respins (their biggest backlash);
  - removing sort/filter and lineup editing (complaints);
  - passing bots off as real opponents;
  - cumulative leaderboards that reward grinding;
  - the same team-decade coming up again and again;
  - letting the client know the opponent's whole lineup and score at the start (their 1v1 does this).

---

## 15. Roadmap

1. **Mockup:** a clickable phone prototype (home → spin → draft → reveal → playoffs → results) in teal and gold.
2. **Core:** data pipeline, Classic + Blind draft, rating engine, season reveal, playoffs, results, share card, guided first draft.
3. **Online:** Supabase accounts, Daily challenge, leaderboards, ranked server-side runs.
4. **Progression:** coins, XP and levels, boosters, nudges, profile and history.
5. **1v1 vs bot**, then friend challenge links.
6. **Next sport.**
